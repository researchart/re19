## Status

We apply for the _Available_ badge.

We think the artifact is _funtional_ and  _well-structured_. It is reusable in a sense that its functionlity can be tested by our sample dataset and it can be resued on other datasets provided by users. 
Users can provide their own sets of requirements and/or a custom word2vec model to train an individual prediction model.

In addition, the artifact is publicly available and archieved (https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.8602382)
