## General Information

This artifact provides the code underlying the RE'19 Paper: 

J.P. Winkler, J. Gr√∂nberg, A. Vogelsang: "Predicting how to test requirements: An automated approach". 27th IEEE International Requirements Engineering Conference (RE), 2019.

The code trains and afterwards evaluates a convolutional neural network that classifies requirements, with regard to its potential verification method. 

Due to non-disclosure agreements, the artifact does not contain the original datasets nor the word2vec models that we used in the paper to evaluate our approach. 
However we provide a sample dataset and a sample pretrained word2vec model, to get an insight into how the code works. 
You can feed the tool with your own set of requirements to train and evaluate the model. 
In this case, please read the installation instructions (INSTALL.md) first.

The artifact is publicly available and archived (https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.8602382)
