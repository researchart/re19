All our scripts are contained in notebooks so they can be run easily.
 * Users need to install [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/install) if they want to run the notebooks on their local machines.
 * [https://colab.research.google.com/](Google Colaboratory) is an online platform to collaborate on such notebooks.

The imported libraries should be installed to run the code properly. The notebooks also have the code to install the libraries, optimized for use in Google Colaboratory.
 * [spaCy](https://spacy.io/) is a natural language processing library.
 * [nltk](https://www.nltk.org/) is a standard natural language processing library.
 * [benepar] (https://github.com/nikitakit/self-attentive-parser/tree/master/benepar) is a linguistic parser based on neural networks.
 * [Skope Rules] (https://github.com/scikit-learn-contrib/skope-rules) creates IF-THEN-ELSE rules to explain the behavior of a black-box classifier.
 * [RuleMatrix](https://github.com/rulematrix/rule-matrix-py.git) creates the logic rules on all platforms but it requires Mac OS to create the waterfall diagram to show the coverage of the rules.
 * The installation of other libraries such as numpy, pandas, and scilearn can be done using pip.
