# Status

## Desired kind of badge

We propose to award the LadderBot with the **Available** badge.

## Reasoning

We believe the artifact to deserve that badge, as we provide a fully functional artifact that may be used as instantiation of a chatbot for conducting laddering requirements elicitation interviews. For a description of the functionality of the artifact, please refer to the README file.

This artifact may be helpful for researchers working on implementing machine learning and artificial intelligence systems for requirements elicitation. Furthermore, the code may be useful as an example of building a bot on Azure using the Microsoft Botkit v4, of which not many comprehensive examples exist in the official documentation. 

The artifact in its current state also serves as a skeleton for future development towards conducting elicitation interviews with end-users. This includes the following to-dos or opportunities that we will also work on in the future.

### To-Dos

* Improve the question-selection intelligence of the tool: Develop measurements to select certain types of questions not based on random but based on user-input or measurements, such as time taken to reply to a question
* Improve the semantic capabilities of LadderBot. Hence, adjusting the bot to react to actual content of user-input rather than using standard (predominantly) preformulated questions
* Improvements towards the automated analysis of laddering interview results
