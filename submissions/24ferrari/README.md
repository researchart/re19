This training package includes the educational material needed to practice the SaPeer approach 
for training students in requirements elicitation interviews. With SaPeer, students receive 
an initial lecture, followed by a role-playing interview experience with a fictional customer. 
Then, they receive a second lecture in which the typical mistakes of student analysts are listed, 
together with recommendations to avoid them. Based on the lecture, they are asked to listen to their 
own interview recording, and perform self-assessment by evaluating the mistakes committed. 
Then, they are also required to peer-review for mistakes the interview of another student. 
After this activity, they perform a second interview, which can be also self-assessed and peer-reviewed. 
At the end of the training, the students are required to reflect on their experience through a feedback questionnaire.
