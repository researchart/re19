# Instructions for reviewers

Thank you for your work on this artifact track.

Please do all work for one submission in one issue. These have already been created for you (so do not create new issues).

Please keep your identy anonymous, for obvious reasons.

- Please note that we leave it up to you whether or not you need to run the artifact.  
- Some artifacts do not execute. Others can't be executed on your machines, for syste,s reasons.

In either case it may still be possible to evaluate the artifacts. Be pragmatic. Be sensible. But if you feel this is unevaula0atble, make a comment in the issues rreport

Please work in three phases

- Phase0: collection
    - do what you need to do to get the files either downloaded or executable or both . In most cases this will just mean checking out
      the repo. But for really big files, you might have to follow user supplied links to find the raw source.
    - duing that period please feel free to interact with the submittors via github
 
- Phase2: reviewed by two people
    - Make your reviewes, asign the badge you think is appropriate, and write sime justification text
      into the comments.
    - When reviewing, please use the criteria 
    - In this phase, until there are two reviews, the  authors should be silent. 
    - In fact, if the authors make any comment in this period, delete/replace them with the text "authors need to wait until
      after two reviews are complete before making comments"
      
- Phase3: discussion seciton 
    - Now reviewers and authors can talk about the open issues. In this phase, please be very clear about your
      criteria for rejection; i.e. list them out and number them. That way, authors can reply by number ("regarding your 
      third point i would reply"
    - Please aloow the authors to make (minor) adjustments to the artifact if those adjustments means it moves from 
      no/low badge to some/higher badge.
