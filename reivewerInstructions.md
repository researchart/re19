# Instructions for reviewers

Thank you for your work on this artifact track.

Please do all work for one submission in one issue. These have already been created for you (so do not create new issues).

Please keep your identy anonymous, for obvious reasons.

Please review artifacts using the following criteria:

<table>
<thead></thead>
<tbody(s)>
<tr><td><strong>Functional</strong>	</td><td align="center"> <strong>Reusable</strong> </td><td align="center"> <strong>Available</strong></td><td align="center"> <strong>Replicated</strong> </td><td align="center"> <strong>Reproduced</strong> </td></tr>
<tr><td>No Badge </td><td align="center"> <dl><img src="https://2019.icse-conferences.org/getImage/orig/red.jpg" alt=""></dl>  </td><td align="center"> <dl><img src="https://2019.icse-conferences.org/getImage/orig/green.jpg" alt=""></dl>	   </td><td align="center">  <dl><img src="https://2019.icse-conferences.org/getImage/orig/blue.jpg" alt=""></dl> </td><td align="center">  <dl><img src="https://2019.icse-conferences.org/getImage/orig/deepBlue.jpg" alt=""></dl> </td></tr>
<tr><td> <!--Functional--> Artifacts documented, consistent, complete, exercisable, and include appropriate evidence of verification and validation </td><td align="center"> <!--Reusable--> Functional + very carefully documented and well-structured to the extent that reuse and repurposing is facilitated. In particular, norms and standards of the research community for artifacts of this type are strictly adhered to. </td><td align="center"> <!--Available-->  Functional + placed on a publicly accessible archival repository. A DOI or link to this repository along with a unique identifier for the object is provided. </td><td align="center"> <!--Replicated--> Available + main results of the paper have been obtained in a subsequent study by a person or team other than the authors, using, in part, artifacts provided by the author. </td><td align="center"> <!--Reproduced--> Available + the main results of the paper have been independently obtained in a subsequent study by a person or team other than the authors, without the use of author-supplied artifacts.</td></tr>

Note that if you download their scripts, and run the code, and get (nearly) the same numbers and figures as the submitter then 
by that act, you have made the artifact **replicated**. 

That said,

- Please note that we leave it up to you whether or not you need to run the artifact.  
- Some artifacts do not execute. Others can't be executed on your machines, for syste,s reasons.

In either case it may still be possible to evaluate the artifacts. Be pragmatic. Be sensible. But if you feel the artifact cannot be evaluated, then  make a comment in the issues rreport

Please work in three phases

- Phase1: **UnderReview**
    - Do what you need to do to get the files either downloaded or executable or both . In most cases this will just mean checking out
      the repo. But for really big files, you might have to follow user supplied links to find the raw source.
    - Duing that period please feel free to interact with the submittors via github (to resolve systems issues).
 
- Phase2: reviewed by two people **FirstReview**, **SecondReview**
    - Make your reviewes, assign the badge you think is appropriate, and write some justification text
      into the comments.
    - You review needs to **ned** with with sentence **"I recommend a badge of XYZ"**.
    - When you are done with reviewing, flip the label on the issue (e.g. to "SecondReview" or to "AuthorComment")
    - When reviewing, please use the criteria shown above.
    - In this phase, until there are two reviews, the  authors should be silent. 
    - In fact, if the authors make any comment in this period, delete/replace them with the text "authors need to wait until
      after two reviews are completed before making comments"
      
- Phase3: discussion  **AuthorComment** 
    - Now reviewers and authors can talk about the open issues. 
    - Please allow the authors to make (minor) adjustments to the artifact if those adjustments means it moves from 
      no/low badge to some/higher badge.
    - In this phase, please be very clear about your
       criteria for rejection; i.e. list them out and number them. That way, authors can reply by number ("regarding your 
      third point i would reply that..."
