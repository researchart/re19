# What has an artifact been?
Artifacts, specifically research artifacts (pretentiously, "artefacts"), are the things we study and the things we produce as a byprodct of the study.

# What is an artifact in RE? 
* Software, which are implementations of systems or algorithms potentially useful in other studies. For instance, tools to search for optimally consistent requirements specifications.
* Machine readable requirements models, e.g. in IstarML or UML interchange formats.
* Traceability relations between artifacts, such as requirements to source code.
* Data repositories, which are data (e.g., requirements models, requirements text, survey raw data) that can be used for multiple software engineering approaches.
* Requirements in natural language form, e.g. textual requirements in a spreadsheet, DOORS, JIRA export.
* User reviews, such as app reviews, product changelogs, and release notes.
* Frameworks, which are tools and services illustrating new approaches to requirements engineering that could be used by other researchers in different contexts. For example, a service to highlight inconsistencies in natural language.
